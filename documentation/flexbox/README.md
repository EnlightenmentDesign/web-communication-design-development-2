## Before you start
Have you looked at the [Documentation](#documentation) and the [Game](#game) sections? If not, please do so before continuing.

To make your learning a bit simpler, I created a template page that has the content you would need to start working on the Flexbox properties learning. **The CSS you write will continue growing and it will be iterative.** If you miss a class it is your responsibility to read the documentation and understand what was covered in the previous class to make sure that you are not falling behind.
