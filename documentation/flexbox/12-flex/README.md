# flex
This is the shorthand for `flex-grow`, `flex-shrink` and `flex-basis` combined. The second and third parameters (flex-shrink and flex-basis) are optional. The default is `flex: 0 1 auto`, but if you set it with a single number value, like `flex: 5`; that changes the flex-basis to 0%, so itâ€™s like setting `flex-grow: 5`; `flex-shrink: 1`; `flex-basis: 0%`;

```
.item {
    flex: none | [ <'flex-grow'> <'flex-shrink'>? || <'flex-basis'> ]
}
```

It is recommended that you use this shorthand property rather than set the individual properties. The shorthand sets the other values intelligently.
